# Genetic Algorithms

The code hosted here contains the implementation of a genetic algorithm engine, some utilities needed
to the engine, and also some examples in order to illustrate its use.

Cloning the repository
===

To clone the repository please follow the next steps (you must have the git software in your system).

1) Choose a folder where the repository will be stored and go to it.
2) Run ``git clone https://github.com/rudyn2/cc5114.git``
3) Ready.

Usage
====

In order to use the genetic algorithm engine you must provide the basics of GA implementations: a fitness function and a 
individual specification. The example showed above implements the minimal code needed to execute a genetic algorithm
that found the solution for the sequence of bits problem (see the description in the sections below).


````
word_to_find = 'ElBromaS'
w_fitness = WordFitness.WordFitness(word_to_find)
ga = GeneticEngine(population_size=100,
                   gen_size=len(word_to_find),
                   mutation_rate=0.8,
                   gen_mutation_rate=0.2,
                   elitism_rate=0.1,
                   fitness_function=w_fitness,
                   individual_generator=WordIndividual.WordIndividual,
                   max_iter=20)

ga.run()
ga.plot_evolution()
````

Example execution
---

In order to give to the first user a fast understanding of the code he can review the TestGA.py code available
in the examples folder. To execute it:

1) Open a terminal.
2) Change your directory to this folder.
3) Execute in the console: ``python Example.py``.
4) Ready.

The example will load the Iris Dataset and train a neural network using some of the tools that this
repository provides.

UML Class
---

As usual, the logic semantic segmentation of the classes for a genetic algorithm are: individuals (that can mutate, 
they can reproduce them and are the building blocks of some population), fitness functions (takes and individual
and can evaluate them accordingly to some user-defined metric), and finally, the genetic 
algorithm engine (executes the logical steps of a genetic algorithm).

Analysis

Implementation
---

* Individuals: Each new individual must be created as a instance of a child class from the Individual class. The
individual class is an pseudo-abstract class that provides the specification for the actions (methods) that an individual
must be able to do, like mutation, cross-over and others. In this class the method eval(Fitness) is implemented and
are therefore it is available for all child classes. 

* Fitness: Each new fitness function definition must be created as a instance of a child class from the Fitness class. 
The Fitness class is also a pseudo-abstract class that provides the specification for the actions that a 
fitness functions must be able to do, these are basically the eval(Individual) method, that takes an individual and 
returns some score using the user-defined procedures.

* PopManager: This is an helper class. Basically, it is a manager of the population. To create a PopManager a fitness
function must be specified. The manager handles the individuals with a simple python array and can perform things like
select the best individual, select some random individuals or calculate theirs scores, all this using the provided 
fitness function. An extra ability of this manager is create a new population of individuals from scratch, 
the method "create" implements this functionality but needs an individual generator as input.

* GeneticEngine: The most important code is here. A genetic engine is a class that execute a classic genetic algorithm
given some parameters, functions and classes. The algorithm is executed as follows. 
    1) Create some random population with N individuals.
    2) Evaluate them using a fitness function. If some condition is reached then it ends.
    3) Selects some proportion of the best individuals.
    4) Selects 2N parents using the Tournament strategy and from them create N children with cross-over.
    5) For each children created, performs a mutation with some probability.
    6) Go to step 2.
    
    At the moment, the only supported criterion is a maximum number of iterations. All the parameters like the 
    probability of mutation, the size of the population, the fitness function, the individual generator, the size of 
    each chromosome, the elitism rate, and others must be provided in the constructor of the engine. Remember that the **fitness function**
    and the **individual generator** must be provided and these are the elements that will define your problem. Once
    that a GA engine is created just call the run() method, to see the evolution of the generation executes the 
    plot_evolution() method. To see in detail the meaning of each parameter please visit the class documentation.
    
* Utils: It has the plot hotmap method that given some gen size, fitness function and a individual generator can plots
a hotmap that shows the performance of the genetic engine for combinations of population sizes and mutation rates.
